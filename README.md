Your friendly WhatsApp booking assistant! Wenly helps you manage and organize bookings effortlessly through WhatsApp.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Prerequisites

This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) as the package manager with [Corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html) for version management. Make sure you have Node.js 16.9+ installed.

## Getting Started

### Enable Corepack

Corepack is included with Node.js 16.9+. Enable it with:

```bash
corepack enable
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Run the Development Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Project Structure

This project uses the Next.js App Router with TypeScript. The main application code is organized in the `src/` directory for better code organization.

## Features

- Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) for fast, production-ready React applications
- Package management via [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) for efficient dependency installation
- Version management via [Corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html) for consistent tooling across the team
- Optimized fonts with [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts)

## Available Scripts

- `pnpm dev` - Start the development server
- `pnpm build` - Build the application for production
- `pnpm start` - Start the production server
- `pnpm lint` - Run ESLint on the project

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Simply connect your GitHub repository to Vercel, and it will automatically detect pnpm as your package manager and handle the build and deployment process.
